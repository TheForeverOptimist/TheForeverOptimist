ğŸ“ˆ Iâ€™m currently the lead backend developer for Elevate's Mobile & Web applications (https://elevate.app/iOS.html).

ğŸš€ I'm a fitness enthusiast with a medical degree that pivoted my career to software development so that I can make an impact globally by strapping the technology rocketship to industries that could use a makeover.
